06:41 Kenshi51  : im bout to do the same lol
06:42 gtrent    : Ive been thinking about building a community garden not far from spawn
06:43 Kenshi51  : that sounds good but at the same time it sounds like it will be abused
06:44 gtrent    : How so?
06:48 Kenshi51  : it could be so if it wasnt claimed then someone can claim it then it will be a whole mess
06:50 gtrent    : I didnt think abou that but i think i can get around it
06:51 gtrent    : If i automated it then icould just make the chest public
06:52 Kenshi51  : yeah i can see that but make it so every chest is for a different thing
